mod_wind with mod_python

This was done, because I didn't want to implement wind groups support
in C.  However, it basically works exactly the same, and has an order of
magnitude less code.

INSTALL
-------
Before you install, you should edit the constants at the top of the
mod_authnz_wind/__init__.py.  Once you do that, if you have setup_tools, just
run 'easy_install .' in the mod_authnz_wind directory with the file setup.py in it.

You're on your own on installing mod_python, but it's a lot easier than 
mod_perl.

Once everything's installed, do something like this in your Apache Conf:
<Directory>
	PythonAuthenHandler mod_authnz_wind
        PythonAuthzHandler mod_authnz_wind
	AuthType Wind
     	AuthName "Restricted Area"
     	#require valid-user
	require group unixgroup.cunix.local:columbia.edu
	#require user sbd12
</Directory>

You might want to debug/test it by putting it in an apache-accessible
directory and set it up like:
<Directory>
        AddHandler mod_python .py
	PythonAuthenHandler mod_authnz_wind
        PythonAuthzHandler mod_authnz_wind
	PythonHandler mod_authnz_wind
        PythonDebug On 
	AuthType Wind
     	AuthName "Restricted Area"
     	require valid-user
	#require group unixgroup.cunix.local:columbia.edu
	#require user abc123 sbd12
</Directory>


CHANGES
-------
version 0.9
 - fixed bug with apache sub-requests
 - supports https
version 0.8
 - no longer using Session across authz so code is less hacky and
   'PythonOption ApplicationPath /' is unnecessary
 - supports coming from ports other than 80

TODO
----
1. make constants configurable in apache conf
2. handle the error strings that validate_windticket() returns better
